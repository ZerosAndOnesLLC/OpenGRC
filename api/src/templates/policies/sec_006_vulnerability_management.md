# Vulnerability Management Policy

**Policy Code:** SEC-006
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** [To be set]
**Review Date:** [Annual review recommended]
**Owner:** [To be assigned - typically IT Security Manager]
**Category:** Security

## 1. Purpose

This Vulnerability Management Policy establishes requirements for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities in [Organization Name]'s information systems. This policy ensures that vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely manner to reduce the organization's exposure to security threats.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- All information systems including servers, workstations, and network devices
- All software including operating systems, applications, and firmware
- Cloud infrastructure and services
- Web applications and APIs
- Third-party and vendor systems that connect to organizational networks
- Container images and configurations

## 3. Policy Statements

### 3.1 Vulnerability Identification

#### 3.1.1 Scanning Requirements
- Vulnerability scans shall be conducted at least monthly for all systems
- Critical systems shall be scanned weekly
- New systems shall be scanned before production deployment
- Scans shall occur after significant changes
- Both authenticated and unauthenticated scans shall be performed

#### 3.1.2 Scanning Coverage
- All network-accessible systems shall be included in scanning scope
- Internal and external scan perspectives shall be used
- Web application scanning shall be performed for all public-facing applications
- Container images shall be scanned before deployment

#### 3.1.3 Threat Intelligence
- Threat intelligence feeds shall be monitored for new vulnerabilities
- Critical vulnerabilities (zero-days, actively exploited) shall trigger immediate assessment
- Vendor security advisories shall be monitored and acted upon

### 3.2 Vulnerability Assessment

#### 3.2.1 Severity Classification

| Severity | CVSS Score | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 | Remote code execution, authentication bypass |
| High | 7.0-8.9 | Privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure |
| Medium | 4.0-6.9 | Cross-site scripting, information disclosure |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 | Minor information disclosure, denial of service |

#### 3.2.2 Risk Assessment
- Vulnerabilities shall be assessed in context of affected systems
- Business criticality shall factor into risk rating
- Exposure (internet-facing vs internal) shall be considered
- Compensating controls shall be documented
- Risk acceptance requires documented approval

### 3.3 Remediation Requirements

#### 3.3.1 Remediation Timelines

| Severity | Internet-Facing | Internal Systems |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Critical | 72 hours | 7 days |
| High | 7 days | 14 days |
| Medium | 30 days | 45 days |
| Low | 90 days | 90 days |

#### 3.3.2 Remediation Methods
- Apply vendor patches when available
- Implement workarounds when patches are not immediately available
- Upgrade or replace unsupported software
- Implement compensating controls when patching is not possible
- Decommission vulnerable systems when appropriate

#### 3.3.3 Emergency Patching
- Critical vulnerabilities being actively exploited require immediate action
- Emergency change procedures may be invoked for critical patches
- Post-implementation review shall occur within 48 hours

### 3.4 Patch Management

#### 3.4.1 Patch Testing
- Security patches shall be tested in non-production environments
- Critical patches may be deployed with abbreviated testing
- Rollback procedures shall be documented
- Testing results shall be documented

#### 3.4.2 Patch Deployment
- Patches shall be deployed during approved maintenance windows
- Critical patches may be deployed outside normal windows
- Deployment shall follow change management procedures
- Patch status shall be verified after deployment

### 3.5 Penetration Testing

- External penetration testing shall be conducted annually
- Internal penetration testing shall be conducted annually
- Web application penetration testing shall be conducted annually
- Penetration testing shall be performed after significant changes
- Findings shall be remediated according to severity timelines

### 3.6 Tracking and Reporting

- All vulnerabilities shall be tracked in a vulnerability management system
- Remediation progress shall be reported weekly to IT leadership
- Monthly vulnerability reports shall be provided to security leadership
- Exceptions and risk acceptances shall be tracked and reviewed quarterly
- Metrics shall include time-to-remediate, vulnerability age, and scan coverage

### 3.7 Third-Party Systems

- Third-party systems shall be included in vulnerability assessments
- Vendor patch cycles shall be monitored
- Vulnerabilities in vendor systems shall be reported to vendors
- Vendor remediation timelines shall be tracked
- End-of-life systems shall be identified and replaced

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| IT Security | Manage vulnerability scanning, prioritize remediation, track metrics |
| IT Operations | Apply patches, implement remediations, maintain systems |
| System Owners | Prioritize system availability for patching, accept residual risk |
| Developers | Remediate application vulnerabilities, implement secure coding |
| Management | Allocate resources, accept risk where appropriate |

## 5. Compliance

### 5.1 Monitoring
- Scan completion rates shall be tracked
- Remediation SLA compliance shall be monitored
- Exception aging shall be reported
- Recurring vulnerabilities shall be analyzed

### 5.2 Enforcement
- Overdue critical/high vulnerabilities shall be escalated to management
- Systems with unaddressed critical vulnerabilities may be isolated
- Repeated non-compliance may result in system decommissioning

## 6. Exceptions

- Exceptions require documented business justification
- Compensating controls must be identified and implemented
- Exceptions require system owner and IT Security approval
- Critical/High exceptions require CISO approval
- Exceptions shall be reviewed quarterly
